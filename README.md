# Golang Context Timeout Example

## Description
This repository provides an example of how to use Golang context with a timeout for handling concurrent operations, such as go routines, HTTP requests, and database queries. The main focus is on controlling the behavior of the code and preventing it from hanging indefinitely by utilizing context with a timeout.

## Code Example
The provided code example in this repository demonstrates how to effectively use context with a timeout when making calls to a third-party API. By following this example, developers can learn how to implement this important feature in their own Golang projects.

## Usage
Developers can refer to the code example in this repository to understand the implementation of Golang context with a timeout. They can use this example as a reference when working on projects that involve concurrent operations and the need to manage timeouts effectively.

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome. Developers can contribute by suggesting improvements to the existing code example, adding new examples, or providing feedback on how to enhance the usage of Golang context with a timeout in different scenarios.
